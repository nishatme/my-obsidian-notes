## Thoughts:

`01.25` onward:
> I though I could steal from everyone else's workflow and make the perfect one. But that's not how it works. In fact all it did was bog me down. For months, I didn't really do much writing, I was just obsessed with getting the perfect setup—which doesn't exist. Thankfully I eventually realised that this system is never going to be perfect. In fact every time I add a new feature, I add a new gimmick—that was a distraction to the true work of writing.

Trying new things out should not be complex at all. It must feel like wearing a new outfit on Eid day or something on the lines of that. Taking `in` tons of information and _tips_ but not actually making true progress on starting out a new activity or thought is—as I think of it—a digital problem. In this age of information overflow, the simple and minimalist approach of `trying new things out` has become cumbersome. I also think, this has to do with `aging old` (because maybe of too much exposure to complexities as we grow old?)

I need to read this book. Maybe? #todo

I am already a slow reader. but although zettelkasten might slow me down further, it shall _deepen my understanding_ thus increasing memory and understanding

Instant feedback is absolutely necessary for _mastering_ any topic, it is especially important in regards to self-study---which I shall have to do, probably for the rest of life.

Freedom to Connect is said to be the most effective feature of zettelkasten, I have yet to understand that by doing it.
