## Thoughs:

`01.25` onwards:
> I though I could steal from everyone else's workflow and make the perfect one. But that's not how it works. In fact all it did was bog me down. For months, I didn't really do much writing, I was just obsessed with getting the perfect setup—which doesn't exist. Thankfully I eventually realised that this system is never going to be perfect. In fact every time I add a new feature, I add a new gimmick—that was a distraction to the true work of writing.

Trying new things out should not be complex at all. It must feel like wearing a new outfit on Eid day or something on the lines of that. Taking `in` tons of information and _tips_ but not actually making true progress on starting out a new activity or thought is—as I think of it—a digital problem. In this age of information overflow, the simple and minimalist approach of `trying new things out` has become cumbersome. I also think, this has to do with `aging old` (because maybe of too much exposure to complexities as we grow old?)




`03.24` onwards:
> these (his thinking that he was unable to **capture** the gist of what he read) all changed by me reading a book called "How to Take Notes" by Sonke Ahrens

I need to read this book. Maybe? #todo



`04.18` onwards:
> There's 3 main ways, it (zettelkasten) is so, so effective: the first main way is that **it forces you to slow down**.
> ...
> In most cases `speed` and `reading` are not a goood mix
> ...
> the slowness of the writing (notes) forces you to dwell on the writer's ideas.
