"By the time a teenager is ready to be jumped into a gang, he is literally prepared to kill and die for his neighborhood. To an outsider, this level of commitment to the gang and the neighborhood seems insane. Maybe you need to have been raised on the varrio to understand how young men can turn their backs on their families and, frankly, the entire non-criminal world and volunteer for a suicide pact with their homeboys."

Here, Corona describes street gang loyalty. Belonging is the glue that holds these groups together. It's a sensation that runs deeped than mere `fun` or `pleasure` ever could. It's _meaning_. A sense of loyalty to fellow gang members paints your life with a purpose, one big enough to risk your life for. Turning your back to society is a tiny loss in comparison. It's _us vs them_, and you'll fight tooth and nail to keep your people on top, no matter what danger come your way.
